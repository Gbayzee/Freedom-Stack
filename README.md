# Freedom-Stack
The Freedom Stack is a free, open-source toolkit that empowers anyone — especially those historically shut out of financial systems — to deploy secure, gas-efficient smart contracts for distributing funds, access, or rights using Merkle proofs.  Developed by Michael Cyranowicz and Sal Jr. and motto is “This tool is free. Because so are you.”
